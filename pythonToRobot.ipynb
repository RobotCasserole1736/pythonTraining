    "First, [install RobotPy on your development computer](https://robotpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/computer.html#install-computer)\n",

    "\n",
    "Finally, create a new folder, and start making some [basic robot code](https://robotpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide/anatomy.html#anatomy)."
