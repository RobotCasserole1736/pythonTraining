Basic software team training for Python

## Key Links

The following are links you should be aware of while starting training.

The [main RobotPy docs](https://robotpy.readthedocs.io/projects/pyfrc/en/stable/index.html) should be referenced for python-specific information.

The [WPILib documentation](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/index.html) has more general FRC robot programming information.

[ThinkPython3](https://greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkpython.pdf) is a free textbook we'll use to help guide the lessons.

Some 3rd-party vendor resources:

 * [Rev Robotics Software](https://www.revrobotics.com/software/)
 * [Cross The Road Electronics (CTRE) Software Documentation](https://v5.docs.ctr-electronics.com/en/stable/)
 * [PhotonVision Software Documentation](https://docs.photonvision.org/en/latest/)
 * [Playing with Fusion (PwF) Software Documentation](https://www.playingwithfusion.com/docview.php?docid=1205)

## Step 4 - WPILib Training

This has to be run locally on your computer, it won't work online.

First, from the start menu, launch a `cmd` console and run the following:

`pip install notebook`

If you haven't yet, clone this repo onto your computer.

Open another cmd in that repo.

To start the training, run the `launchTraining.bat` . The training should pop up in a web browser.
