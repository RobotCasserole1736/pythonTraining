    "## Duck Typing\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses a \"duck typing\" strategy. With very few exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything in python is simply an \"object\". The type is fully generic, and makes very few assumptions about the object itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Duck typing works by delaying any question about whether \"X can do Y\" or \"X has member Y\" until runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is to say, when you call `foo.bar()`, it is only at runtime that checks whether object `foo` contains a method named `bar`. It doesn't matter how `foo` got a method `bar`, or whether other objects also have a `bar()` method, or what `bar()` returns - it simply goes looking for anything named `bar()` and calls it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This yields a phenomenal level of flexibility as a software developer."
